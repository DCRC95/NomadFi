# Project Context: Multi-Chain Yield Aggregator dApp

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a decentralized application (dApp) that functions as a yield aggregator. This dApp aims to allow users to deposit tokens into strategies that invest across various blockchain networks, providing a unified view of their aggregated yield. The core concept is to have a single, central `YieldAggregator` smart contract (deployed on Polygon Amoy) that tracks and manages strategies potentially deployed on different EVM-compatible testnets (e.g., Amoy, Sepolia).

## Current Status (MVP Complete)
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is currently complete. Key features implemented include:
* **Smart Contracts:**
    * `YieldAggregator.sol` deployed on Polygon Amoy. It allows for the registration of strategies.
    * `MockERC20.sol` (a mock ERC-20 token) deployed on both Polygon Amoy and Sepolia.
    * `MockYieldStrategy.sol` (a mock yield-generating strategy) deployed on both Polygon Amoy and Sepolia.
    * Conceptual `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions in `YieldAggregator.sol` that track internal balances (no actual token transfers for MVP).
    * `apy()` function in `MockYieldStrategy.sol` for conceptual APY calculation.
* **Next.js Frontend:**
    * Connects to a user's wallet via RainbowKit/Wagmi.
    * Displays a list of strategies fetched from a Next.js API route.
    * Allows users to conceptually "deposit" and "withdraw" from strategies.
    * Includes a Next.js API route (`/api/strategies`) that aggregates information (including APY) from strategies across multiple chains by querying the central `YieldAggregator` on Amoy and then individual `MockYieldStrategy` contracts on their respective chains. This API route correctly uses environment variables for RPC URLs and contract addresses.

## Future Development Plan (Next 3 Weeks)

We are now embarking on a 3-week development phase to enhance the dApp significantly, focusing on practical functionality and demonstrating advanced blockchain concepts.

### **Week 1: Core Functionality - Real Token Transfers**
**Objective:** Implement actual ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals, transforming the dApp from conceptual to functional.

* **Smart Contract Refinement (`YieldAggregator.sol`):**
    * Integrate `IERC20` and `SafeERC20` for secure token interactions.
    * Modify `deposit()`: Use `IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount)` to pull tokens.
    * Modify `withdraw()`: Use `IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _amount)` to send tokens.
    * Implement `isSupportedToken` mapping and owner-only `addSupportedToken`/`removeSupportedToken` functions.
    * Emit `Deposit` and `Withdrawal` events for all transfers.
    * Deploy updated contracts.
* **Frontend Integration (Next.js/Wagmi):**
    * Display user's actual wallet balance of `MockERC20` tokens.
    * Display user's actual deposited balances within the `YieldAggregator` for each strategy.
    * Implement an "Approve Token" UI/button using `useWriteContract` to call `ERC20.approve()` on `MockERC20` before deposits.
    * Update "Deposit" and "Withdraw" buttons to trigger `useWriteContract` calls to the new `YieldAggregator` functions.
    * Implement robust loading, success, and error handling for all transactions.

### **Week 2: Real Yield Integration & Enhanced User Feedback**
**Objective:** Integrate with a simple, real DeFi protocol on a testnet, and provide basic transaction history.

* **Integration with a Real DeFi Protocol (Simple Lending/Borrowing):**
    * Create a `RealYieldStrategy.sol` contract to replace/complement `MockYieldStrategy`.
    * This contract will interact with a chosen testnet DeFi protocol (e.g., Aave V3 on Sepolia/Amoy).
    * Its `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `apy()` functions will call the external protocol's contracts for real interactions and APY data.
    * Update `YieldAggregator` to register and interact with this `RealYieldStrategy`.
    * Deploy and register new `RealYieldStrategy` instances.
* **On-Chain Event Tracking & Basic History:**
    * Utilize Wagmi/Viem to listen for `Deposit` and `Withdrawal` events emitted by the `YieldAggregator`.
    * Display a simple "Transaction History" section in the UI showing these events (user, token, amount, strategy, timestamp, transaction hash).

### **Week 3: Polish, Optimization & Presentation**
**Objective:** Refine the dApp, ensure robust performance, and prepare a compelling demonstration.

* **Gas Optimization (Smart Contracts):**
    * Review and apply simple gas-saving techniques (e.g., `unchecked` arithmetic, storage packing, efficient data types).
* **UI/UX Polish & Error Handling:**
    * Implement comprehensive loading states, toast notifications for transactions.
    * Add frontend input validation.
    * Ensure responsiveness and clear error messages.
* **Comprehensive Testing & Debugging:**
    * Perform thorough end-to-end testing of all new and existing features across different scenarios and chains.
    * Test edge cases.
* **Documentation & Demo Preparation:**
    * Update `README.md` with setup, deployment, and interaction instructions for the enhanced dApp.
    * Prepare a detailed project report/documentation covering architecture, design choices, challenges, and solutions.
    * Plan and practice a compelling demo script highlighting all key features for maximum impact.
    * Final deployment to Vercel/Netlify.
